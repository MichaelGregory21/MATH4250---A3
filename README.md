# MATH4250---A3

To get the results in table 1, run sarsa() for the sarsa table and run qlearning() for the qlearning table

To get graphs that appear in figures 2 and 3, run: graph(graph_type)

where graph_type = 'sarsa' for the sarsa graph and graph_type = 'q' for the q-learning graph

To get the heatmaps in figure 5, run gradient_mc(policy, value_function) for the gradient_mc map and run semi_gradient_td_0(policy, value_function) for the semi-gradient td(0) map where policy and value_function have already been defined
